Examples of code from MAGD 150 course

## Assignment 1

[Code for Assignment One](https://github.com/Thingamajig3053/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/master/Assignment%5BOne%5D.pde)
*Assignment One focused on utlilizing shapes, with a grayscale palette, in Processing to adhere to the week's theme. For this particular project, the theme was: buildings.*

## Assignment 2

[Code for Assignment Two](https://github.com/Thingamajig3053/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/master/Assignment%5BTwo%5D.pde)
*The topic for this assignment was space. Using triangles I attempted to create a star-like shape. I then used quadrilaterals to create a ship, heading in the direction of the light.*

## Assignment 5

[Code for Assignment Five](https://github.com/Thingamajig3053/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/master/Assignment%5BFive%5D.pde)
*This assignment centered around creating functional buttons in Processing. I made two, to acheive a sort of "dimensional transport" atmosphere. When the starter button was pressed, it triggered text that would appear in the console. When the warp button was pressed and/or held, the screen would turn white and more text would appear on the console.*

## Assignment 8

[Code for Assignment Eight](https://github.com/Thingamajig3053/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/master/Assignment%5BEight%5D.pde)
*I chose to make a mock movie poster of a legendary character from the show Jimmy Neutron: Bolbi Stroganovsky. Certain fonts were loaded for the poster, and the PDFs can even be created by pressing a key.*

## Assignment 9

[Code for Assignment Nine](https://github.com/Thingamajig3053/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/master/Assignment%5BNine%5D.pde)
*The subject of this assignment was mirrors. Namely, using Processing to trigger camera playbacks and audio effects.*
